<p>JavaScript was relatively simple to pick up thanks to prior knowledge of the Java and C languages. I personally felt that JavaScript was a happy medium between the two, a bridge of the languages in a sense.</p>

<p>In Java, each class would be its own defined file (at least while using an Eclipse IDE). You would have the constructors and variables, then include the class methods. You would also have a file that would include your main method that would run all the necessary functions for your program to work. In comparison, JavaScript has NO main method and you can run the program at any point within your code. You also list your classes rather than having them all in separate locations. I found JavaScript to be a bit more user friendly on JSFiddle in that sense. However, on a larger scale project, I can see this running into issues as you would have an immensely difficult time finding a specific class or function within the large number of lines of code.</p>

<p>In C languages, there is a greater focus on knowledge of the address of your variables and objects. It’s a tricky language to use, since a slight error can cause the entire program to fail and be extremely difficult to trace. In this sense, JavaScript acts more like Java where the language handles the addresses and other tricky components.</p>

<p>The common theme that arises is that JavaScript feels more user friendly than the other programming languages that I have used so far. However, as a software engineer in a larger company, you would likely run into issues of code compiling when some of your classes might not be fully functional if multiple people are working on it at a time. Just the fact that all of the classes are in one place also makes it a logistical nightmare when it comes to debugging or tracing.</p>

<p>WODs (Workout of the Day) are assignments that we are tasked to complete within a certain timeframe in class. Since we have class two days a week, we spend the first day on a practice WOD which is basically a teaser to the WOD that we have to work on in the second class of the week.</p>

<p>The practice WODs are useful, however I do not like the use of it as an all or nothing grading style on a 100-point system. I could understand if it was on content that I’ve been familiar with and have fully learned, but the fact that I’m in the process of learning it while doing these WODs feels completely unfair. If we were using the WODs purely as practice, I feel like it would be a fun exercise where I feel free to experiment. I feel that it is unnecessarily stressful and has a largely detrimental effect on my grade. I understand that there is the aspect of relation to job interviews, but frankly I’m not at the level where I would even feel comfortable taking one anyways. Without the grading aspect I think I would genuinely enjoy the WODs AND actually improve as a programmer.</p>

<h2 id="reflection-on-wods-at-the-end-of-the-semester">Reflection on WODs at the End of the Semester</h2>
<p>As I grew more knowledgeable on the elements that we covered throughout the duration of the semester, I was able to improve on my performance for the WODs. My grade did take a substantial hit due to failing several of the WODs, despite being incredibly close to the correct answer each time. I felt that if they were graded on a scale, I likely would have gotten above a 90/100 on the ones that I failed. I believe that the punishing aspect of the WOD grading style is not outweighted by the ideology behind it (being that it should resemble a job interview). This should be a learning environment, and I have a strong opinion that students develop better when they are allowed to learn from their mistakes rather than be expected to get a problem 100% correct on the first try.</p>

<p>I gained a lot of experience and mastery in HTML/CSS as well as the frameworks that enhance them and it is a shame that the development I had as a student was not reflected in my grades for my WODs.</p>
