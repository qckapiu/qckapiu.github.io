In ICS 314, we covered software development and built a portfolio on GitHub comprised of the projects and essays that we were assigned throughout the duration of the semester. I've listed the core concepts that we covered in class below, but for the sake of time (and the asignment's guidelines) I will only cover a few of them.

## Core Concepts
- [Open Source Software Development](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f23/modules/open-source-software/)
- [Configuration Management](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f23/modules/configuration-management/)
- [Functional Programming](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f23/modules/javascript-3/)
- [Development Environments](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f23/modules/development-environments/)
- [Coding Standards](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f23/modules/coding-standards/)
- [User Interface Frameworks](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f23/modules/ui-frameworks/)
