# Project: UH Manoa Campus Food Database

## Overview
### The problem:
It's lunchtime and you decide it is time to eat. You Google "places to eat nearby" and get a random assortment of restaurants and ended up even more stumped than before. Perhaps you feel like eating a burger but aren't sure which restaurant serves burgers, or which ones are even any good.

### The solution:
By creating a database that catalogs all of the restaurants on campus, we would have a centralized source of information containing various menu items and prices. A user would be able to rate an item, and highly rated items would encourage other users to try it. Users would also be able to favorite both restaurants and items, which would allow them to find their favorite meals faster. Restaurant employees could be given special "restaurant admin" privileges to add or adjust menu items. The main admin would be able to add or remove restaurants as needed.

## Mockup page ideas
- landing page
- user home page
- admin home page
- restaurant admin home page (beyond the basics)
- sign up page
- login page
- new user info page
- favorites page
- restaurant locations/list page
- individual restaurant pages
- menu item search and compare page (beyond the basics)

## Use case ideas
- new user: gets landing page, selects sign up, gets sign up page, sets up profile, gets new user info page, gets user home page (looks through restaurants to decide what to eat/drink, selects favorite items/restaurants, rates items/restaurants)
- admin: gets landing page, selects login, gets login page, gets admin home page (edits site)
- returning user: gets landing page, selects login, gets login form, gets user home page (looks through restaurants to decide what to eat/drink, selects favorite items/restaurants, rates items/restaurants)
- restaurant admin (beyond the basics): gets landing page, selects login, gets login form, gets restaurant admin home page (edits restaurant details)

## Beyond the basics
- provide Search functionality for specific food/drink items and let you compare prices of similar items between various restaurants
- create a mobile app version for easier use
- recent restaurant or menu item changes are automatically updated and shown on home pages
- highly rated items/restaurants featured on home pages, automatically updated as ratings change
