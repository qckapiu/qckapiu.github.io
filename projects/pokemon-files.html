 <h2 id="readwrite-file">Read/Write File</h2>
<p>I created the functions readfile and writefile. These functions would access an array that would either be loaded with Pokemon from a file (readfile) or load a file from an array of Pokemon (writefile).</p>

<h2 id="driver">Driver</h2>
<p>This program used a driver to call the functions and execute the code. I created a few test cases by adding various Pokemon by including the species and level. These were added into the array “pokemonbank”. Once the array was filled, I would call writefile and overwrite the previous contents with the list of Pokemon. I conducted various cases to make sure that the program worked as intended.</p>

<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p>Below is a screenshot of an example output from the program.

<h2 id="experience-gained">Experience Gained</h2>
<p>This project required us to have a solid understanding of the addresses of each variable and how they were linked. If the implementation was done incorrectly, this could lead to the array pointing to a NULL address or even worse it could point to an address of a variable that already exists. This could lead to the program inadvertantly changing variables without your intent.</p>

<p>This project also required us to conduct test cases for our program to ensure that each of our functions were working as intended. I was able to improve on cleaning up my code to ensure that the test cases ran smoothly.</p>
