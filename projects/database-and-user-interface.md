summary: "In ICS 212 I developed a database and a UI interface. This database would read records from a file and accept user input. The user would be able to add, remove, find, and print records."

# Database
The database I created stored records that contained an account number, name, and address in a linked list. This project required me to be able to keep track of the address of each record and how it connected to other records in the linked list. In the database, I defined the following functions:
  - addRecord: adds a new record and inserts it in the list based off of account number
  - findRecord: finds all records with the specified account number
  - printAllRecords: prints in the console the list of all records
  - deleteRecord: deletes all records with the specified account number

Additionally the program needed to read a specified file upon start up, and write on a specified file and free the allocated space when the user selected the quit option.

# User Interface
The user interface I created allowed the user to select between the following options:
  - add: create a new record
  - printall: print all existing records
  - find: find an existing record
  - delete: delete an existing record
  - quit: exit program

Even if the user only typed a few letters of the option such as "ad", the program would still execute the add option. This allows the user to simply type "q" to quit. However, if the user input an incorrect option, the program would print that it was an invalid entry. I needed to design the user interface so that it was intuitive to the user. If a record was added or found, I would print the specified record if it was successful. Otherwise, the program would print that there was an error.

# Output
Below is a screenshot of an example output from the program.
