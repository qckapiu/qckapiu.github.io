# Class Inheritance
This project focused on class inheritance for both subclasses and superclasses. Pokemon was the superclass and was the parent to the following three subclasses: Flamigo, Flygon, and Pikachu.

The subclasses inherited the variables and methods from the Pokemon class and defined them differently depending on the subclass.

# Maps
The program stored the Pokemon objects into a map and used the given nicknames as keys. I needed to create the function checkPokedex that would print the data of all the Pokemon stored in the party.

# Output
Below is a screenshot of an example output from the program.
